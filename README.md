# AFR-Scraper
A small class I wrote in Python using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape daily news publication information from the Australian Financial Review and store it in a pandas DataFrame


The script crawls the www.afr.com homepage and retrieves data from the various news articles including title, summary, topic, url and date and appends the information to a new row in a pandas DataFrame.
