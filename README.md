# AFR-Scraper
A small class I wrote in Python using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape daily news publication information from the Australian Financial Review and store it in a pandas DataFrame


The script crawls www.afr.com/ and retrieves data from news article's title, summary, topic, url and date and appends the information to a new row in a pandas DataFrame.
